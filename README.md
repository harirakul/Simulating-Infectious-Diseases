- Population: Thu number of agents in the environment.
- Transmission Rate: The likelihood of contracting the disease after contact with an infected agent.
- Death Rate: The likelihood of death after the period of illness.
- Infection Duration: The length of time after contracting a disease in which an agent will be able to transmit the disease.
- Social Distancing: The percentage of the population that will remain stationary.

## Agent-Based Simulation:

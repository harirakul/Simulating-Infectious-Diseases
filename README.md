- **Population**: The number of agents in the environment.
- **Transmission Rate**: The likelihood of contracting the disease after contact with an infected agent.
- **Death Rate**: The likelihood of death after the period of illness.
- **Infection Duration**: The length of time after contracting a disease in which an agent will be able to transmit the disease.
- **Social Distancing**: The percentage of the population that will remain stationary.
